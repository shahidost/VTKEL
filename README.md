Visual-textual-knowledge-linking (VTKL) dataset, contains documents composed of pictures with five corresponding textual captions. The VTKL dataset is obtained by extending the Flikr30k dataset, designed for visual-textual mention alignment, with links to YAGO, one of the largest web knowledge base. These links are obtained automatically by processing each image caption with PIKES, an NLP tool for entity recognition and linking.
